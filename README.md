### Future updates currently planned. No guarantee they are added

- `/watchlistpick <profile_name>` - grabs a users' watchlist and randomly selects one film from the list.
- Movie images. Currently images cannot be scraped from Letterboxd, will look into getting them some other way to include in posts.

##  Notes

- The bot can only be used in the channel specified with `/setchannel`.
- It only tracks users' **Diary** activity, not other types of interactions (e.g., likes or reviews outside of diary entries).
- The `/add` command verifies that the Letterboxd profile exists. Make sure the profile name matches the profiles full name, not a display name (Can verify based on the url when viewing their profile).
- Dockerfile was initialized, but never finished.
